In the trench, place a seed potato piece, cut side down, every 12 to 14 inches and cover with 3 to 4 inches of soil. The best starters are seed potatoes from which eyes (buds) protrude. (Do not confuse seed potatoes with potato seeds or grocery produce.) Use a clean, sharp paring knife to cut large potatoes into pieces that are roughly the size of a golf ball, making sure that there are at least 2 eyes on each piece.

The plants need 1 to 2 inches of water per week. If you water too much right after planting and not enough as the potatoes begin to form, the tubers can become misshapen."]

Then, water regularly. It’s best to water the plant deeply at the soil line, then let the soil dry out (though not completely) and water again. Water your tree well into mid-October to give it plenty of moisture through the winter months.Do not fertilize young fruit trees until they have set a crop.
